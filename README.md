## Hi There, My name is James Diable.
<p>After more than a decade of hands-on experience in gardening across the Wirral, I took the leap two years ago to turn my passion into a full-time venture. Starting my own gardening business was a bold move, and it's been incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>I'm also a fully qualified plumber, having completed my apprenticeship with Wirral Borough Council. I later spent two years working at Cammell Laird shipyard as a pipe fitter, gaining valuable hands-on experience in a demanding industrial environment.</p>
